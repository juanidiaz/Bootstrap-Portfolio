> **Project Description**

Our web version of the popular memory card game where the objective is to collect the most pairs of cards. This version will allow a player to play any of three modes: **easy** (just chose the number of pairs), **timed** (same as easy but with timed countdown) and **challenge** (a progressively difficult game). The player will also be able to log his/her game stats on a leader board using name and country.
